Augmented Cards App

It works only on real devices. Feel free to check the code!

The app will take a photo of the business card, through vision framework I'll get the frame and with the help of ML and TextDetectors I am able to figure out where the name, e-mail adress and phone number is. Then I augment this information (along with downloading users avatar) over the card.

This was a proof of concept for my idea, hence you will find some code smells inside. Please disregard them :)

Video of how it works is inside this repository - find "demo.mov"
